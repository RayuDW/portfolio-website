How do websites actually work?

Websites consist of three deifferent file types. 

HTML files - the main structure of a website
CSS files - te "color" of the website; used for styling components
JS files - gives the site functionality

When you access a webite, your browser is asking the server for those three types of files. 
What you see on the screen is what those files are delivering.
