10_Font Sizes

Font sizes in CSS can be set with four different units:
- px (pixel, which equals 1/96th of an inch (or 0.26mm))
- pt (point, which equals 1/72nd of an inch (or 0.35mm))
- em (1em == 100% of the parent element)
- rem (1rem == 100% of the root element; usually the <html> element)

Imagine we have a <p> inside a <body> element. 
Inside this <body> element, we set the font size to 20px. 
The <p> element gets a font-size of 2em, and therefore 2x20px == 40px!
