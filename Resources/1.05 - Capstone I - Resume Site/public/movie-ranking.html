<h2>Pixels</h2>
<p>
  A great movie with Adam Sandler which makes games come alive and even create
  atmospheric places and battles inside the real world! With the game mechanics
  you learned to love as a kid!
</p>
<h2>Everywhere, everyone, all at once</h2>
<p>
  This movie is mind-blowingly amazing. do not expect anything to be just a
  static decoration. And if you like multiverse movies, you'll gonna love this!
</p>
<h2>Digimon Movies</h2>
<p>Digimon has always been great, and so are most of the movies!</p>
